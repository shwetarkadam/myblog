<p>Another situation could also be coming across a concept or bug for which you might have got the solution for but not understood it completely or would like to study it further.</p>
<p>While these things are what makes us feel good about ourselves.It is important to not lose sight of the main goal or bug you are trying to solve.</p>
<p>One thing I find myself doing these days  is focusing on the prioritised issue at hand first.Ask a senior or engineer who has more context and information about the issue at hand.
And simultaneously note down the topics which I didn&rsquo;t understand completely in another place (sublime or self slack) for me to refer later and learn once the work storm calms down.</p>
<p>This is one way I could to get back to learning new things&hellip;..</p>
