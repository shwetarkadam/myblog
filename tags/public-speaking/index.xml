      <description>My First Tech Talk: The Journey from Panic to Presentation I recently had an opportunity to give a technical talk at GitTogether Mumbai. This is a small blog post based on my experience of giving a talk and a little behind-the-scenes turmoil written as a blog post.
How Do You Secure a Speaking Slot? This was the big question! It took me countless applications, several rejections, and a sprinkle of luck.</description>

<p>I recently had an opportunity to give a technical talk at GitTogether Mumbai. This is a small blog post based on my experience of giving a talk and a little behind-the-scenes turmoil written as a blog post.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-secure-a-speaking-slot">How Do You Secure a Speaking Slot?</h2>
<p>This was the big question! It took me countless applications, several rejections, and a sprinkle of luck. The trick? Pitch a talk that fits what the audience and organizers are looking for—it&rsquo;s all about relevance.</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-after-my-talk-was-selected">What happens after my talk was selected?</h2>
<p>The talk has been selected &hellip;&hellip;so now what?
The Panic strikes through!!
But so does the cycle of preparation&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/presentation.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<h2 id="will-they-find-it-interesting">Will They Find It Interesting?</h2>
<p>Creating a talk is one thing, delivering it in a way that keeps the audience engaged is another.
Once the panic and excitement strikes through so does the preparation. Preparing the contents for a talk is very different from presenting it. The information you INTEND to convey has to reach the audience in a way they perceive it and it has to be relatable and interesting for them to continue to listen!</p>
<h2 id="feedback-feedback-feedback-and-continuous-feedback">Feedback Feedback Feedback and Continuous Feedback!</h2>
<p>Ah yes, feedback—every speaker’s best friend (and occasional frenemy). It’s the secret sauce to leveling up your presentation, and trust me, you’ll need lots of it! I took every nugget of constructive criticism and tweaked my talk like a codebase on release day.</p>
<p>Now, let’s talk demos. The ultimate double-edged sword. Engineers love them but for presenters? A living nightmare! And guess what? I willingly walked into that nightmare. Yep, I gave a demo!</p>
<p>Why? Well, demos are like live-action thrillers—great for the audience but full of nerve-wracking moments for the speaker. Something is bound to go wrong (and spoiler: it did). Cue the sweaty palms and heart palpitations as things start to go wrong! But hey, the key is to stay calm, crack a joke or two, and power through the glitches.</p>
<p>In hindsight, the demo could’ve been smoother, but for my first big talk, it wasn’t a complete disaster. Want to witness the chaos? Here’s the link to the demo fail <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_D0SG0yMEk">Link</a> I’m open to feedback (and maybe a little sympathy)!</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Every developer should experience the thrill of presenting their work to an appreciative public audience. It&rsquo;s more than just sharing your knowledge—it’s a chance to push your limits, boost your confidence, and ignite a deeper passion for learning. Stepping onto that stage changes the way you see yourself as a developer, fueling your drive to grow and evolve. Plus, there’s nothing quite like the energy of connecting with others and realizing how far you’ve come on your journey!</p>
<p>Do checkout my presentation link and feel free to provide any feedback via <a href="hello@shweta.io">email</a> or on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shwetarkadam/">Linkedin</a>!</p>

      <title> Exploring TLS Automation — A Proof of Concept with n8n and Vault</title>

      <description>Exploring TLS Automation — A Proof of Concept with n8n and Vault Managing TLS certificates often means chasing expiry dates, setting reminders, and manually rotating certs—a process that’s fragile and prone to outages.

<p>Managing TLS certificates often means chasing expiry dates, setting reminders, and manually rotating certs—a process that’s fragile and prone to outages. To prove there’s a better way, I built a prototype combining n8n and HashiCorp Vault that demonstrates the power of automation, and had the opportunity to present this work as a talk at Mumbai FOSS 2025.
The Prototype in Action</p>
<p>The workflow I showcased was simple yet powerful:</p>
<p>Monitoring expiry with early alerts</p>
<p>Triggering automatic renewals via Vault’s PKI engine</p>
<p>Deploying renewed certificates without manual steps</p>
<p>Validating results in Vault for full transparency</p>
<p>This wasn’t a slide deck—it was about demonstrating the ability such a system can provide: hands-off certificate lifecycle management, built entirely on open-source tools.</p>
<p>Why n8n + Vault?</p>
<p>n8n brings the flexibility of a visual automation platform—easy to extend, no coding required for most steps.</p>
<p>Vault provides a battle-tested PKI engine with strong security guarantees.</p>
<p>Together, they eliminate vendor lock-in, subscription costs, and opaque “black box” processes.</p>
<p>Beyond the Demo</p>
<p>While I shared this prototype in a lightning talk at Mumbai FOSS 2025, the real takeaway is that any team can replicate it today. Whether managing a handful of certs or rolling this out across multiple environments, the approach scales with your needs.</p>
<p>As a bonus, this same session was also wait-listed for the Open Source Summit India 2025, highlighting the growing interest in practical, open-source security automation.</p>
