      <description>I tried a lot of things in January not necessarily everything learnt was used and and not every side project which I worked on got live.
However I learnt many lessons from my own failures and gained more insights when I started some initiatives. So just a small gist of looking back on January and mid February.
My Blog! codeklutz.com I have been wanting to make my own tech blog for a while now but I needed something which didn‚Äôt necessary requires much code or db maintenance.</description>

<p>However I learnt many lessons from my own failures and gained more insights when I started some initiatives. So just a small gist of looking back on January and mid February.</p>
<h2 id="my-blog-codeklutz-dot-com">My Blog! <a href="https://codeklutz.com">codeklutz.com</a></h2>
<p>I have been wanting to make my own tech blog for a while now but I needed something which didn‚Äôt necessary requires much code or db maintenance.I didn‚Äôt want to opt for WordPress for the same reason.</p>
<p>Jekyll with GitHub pages is a life saver here! Also learnt a lot on custom domains after buying my own domain,about Google analytic and SEO.Plus customising Jekyll site with themes has been fun.</p>
<h2 id="letters-to-me">Letters to me</h2>
<p>This idea struck me in the wee hours at night.I always get some random tech ideas or where I am curious about something and think about it as to how I would do this particular task.</p>
<p>I think of this site as an idea jar üí° or tech journal üìù where I jot down my wacky, scrambling thoughts.Something which I can look back on for ideas when I don‚Äôt feel creative or as starting thinking point for my small side projects.Some tech thoughts which aren‚Äôt polished enough for a blog but are useful tiny ideas which provide insight.
Also since it‚Äôs on the internet maybe someone might find it useful or insightful? I‚Äôm thinking of adding an rss feed to this in the future if anyone would be interested in following this.</p>
<h2 id="expiermenting-with-audio-in-blogs">Expiermenting with audio in blogs</h2>
<p>Based on the idea mentioned in letters.codeklutz.com decided to implement an audio feature for this blog.I tried finding some open source or free alternative.And I did find one but sadly this one proved to be a failure at the current moment.</p>
<p>The audio is decent but the voices which I found are too mechanical and monotonous to listen continuously.I shall still try finding some open source alternative because I don‚Äôt want to invest in paid alternatives for this small blog at the moment.</p>
<h2 id="noteklutz-https-note-dot-codeklutz-dot-com">NoteKlutz <a href="https://note.codeklutz.com">https://note.codeklutz.com</a></h2>
<p>This mini project is again a part of implementation of the idea mentioned in letters.codeklutz.com It already proving to be useful;) I realised I write more markdown (for creating study notes +writing this blog) so I felt the need to create my own editor which is suited for myself and at the same time not fear giving my data to someone or idk?(lmao)</p>
<p>But main focus was not to use another app just to create notes and since I use browser more than anything else this seemed like a good idea</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a small,minimal project which does exactly what I need it to do and does it right (at least for me biased hereü§´) It‚Äôs like my second organising brain üß†.The code is an absolute mess and needs heavy work which I will do my pushing small updates on weekendsü§≠.</p>
<p>So this was all for January and Mid Feb</p>

      <title>Which would you go for? Spring boot cron job,scheduled tasks vs Events in Mysql.</title>

      <description>I was recently studying about using cron jobs in spring boot for a particular use case for my small side project. I ended up not using the cron job but rather went the SQL way(will explain this in detail below). However,in the process I learnt a lot about cron jobs and scheduling in spring boot so this is just a small article about my learnings.
But first I shall tell you a little about my use case and why I thought about cron jobs in the first place‚Ä¶.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was recently studying about using cron jobs in spring boot for a particular use case for my small side project. I ended up not using the cron job but rather went the SQL way(will explain this in detail below). However,in the process I learnt a lot about cron jobs and scheduling in spring boot so this is just a small article about my learnings.</p>
<p>But first I shall tell you a little about my use case and why I thought about cron jobs in the first place‚Ä¶..</p>
<h2 id="use-case">Use case</h2>
<p>My application was inserting data (let‚Äôs call it smash data for simplicity for now)in the database.Each smash data has a certain expiry period and after that expiry period, that data should no longer remain in the database.But the expiry period will be different for each smash data.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>smash 1, expiryperiod :10mins</p>
<p>smash 2 ,expiryperiod :60mins</p>
<p>smash 3 ,expiryperiod :150mins . . . etc.</p>
<p>Now my first line of thinking ended up being cron jobs which led to me studying about cron jobs and scheduled in spring boot.To answer it simply I didn‚Äôt end up taking this route is because cron jobs or scheduled tasks are suited when we expect the task to execute at only a particular point of time or where we expect functionality to be executed at w particular time on an hourly/daily /weekly/monthly basis. I could get the cron job to delete the data but to delete WHICH data smash 1 or smash 2? That would mean I would have to check the DB. So the process would be something like:-</p>
<p>Fetch all rows from DB.
Check timestamp of each row data against current timestamp and delete accordingly.
I wanted to avoid writing the searching, comparing time logic (dates, in general, can be a pain sometimes).The logic which I did ended up going through was events in SQL since I‚Äôm using MySQL db for the use case</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mysql events are tasks that run according to a particular schedule ‚Ä¶hence they can be called as scheduled events</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When an event is created in MySQL, a named database object is created and this object consists of one or more SQL statements to be executed at some regular intervals.Using events,I didn‚Äôt have to retrieve and search the data (as I had to do in the spring boot controller ) . I could just write an event such as</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">Delete</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">table1</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">where</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w"></span><span class="n">expiry</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">period</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">NOW</span><span class="p">();</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>And schedule this to execute <code>every minute</code>. Which was would check for that expiryPeriod column in each row and compare with time NOW() So any rows whose expiryperiod has passed will be deleted from db.</p>
<p>The only thing to note I see in this approach, for now, is that this is database dependent so when I host this side project (a hopeful dream) I need to make sure events is configured for the same. So this was the use case now back to cron jobs!</p>
<h2 id="cron-jobs-or-schedule-tasks-in-spring-boot-dot-permalink">Cron jobs or schedule tasks in spring boot.Permalink</h2>
<p>When a situation arises where we expect the task to execute at only a particular point of time or where we expect functionality to be executed at a particular time on an hourly/daily /weekly/monthly basis. Cron jobs are suitable for this use case. In spring this sort of scheduled task can be achieved through @Scheduled annotation.</p>
<p>There are a few rules while using the @Scheduled annotation:  1. The method should typically have a void return type else the returned value will be ignored.</p>
<p>the method should not expect any parameters. First, to enable scheduling in the spring boot project, use @EnableScheduling in the main class.</p>
