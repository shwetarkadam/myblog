      <description>These days I am more into creating backend projects which include microservices.But if anyone wants to test these services one needs postman or do the old classic way of curl command.
Both do the job brilliantly but what if I wanted some user who doesn’t want to install postman or use curl and still wants to test my live APIs thru the browser? I came across this swagger open API specification and this is a really handy tool!</description>

      <description>I was recently studying about using cron jobs in spring boot for a particular use case for my small side project. I ended up not using the cron job but rather went the SQL way(will explain this in detail below). However,in the process I learnt a lot about cron jobs and scheduling in spring boot so this is just a small article about my learnings.
But first I shall tell you a little about my use case and why I thought about cron jobs in the first place….</description>
