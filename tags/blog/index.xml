      <description>Recently got an opportunity to work on angular project.With no previous experience in angular, I had some catch up to do in terms of web development.So here is a small blog post.
What is Angular ? Framework to build client side applications.
Why would you use Angular? Vanilla JQuery code gets harder to maintain,harder to test.
And like all most of the frameworks Junction, Angular provides:
Angular gave our applications clean structure.</description>

<p>Like java has a main file. Similarly in angular, there is a <code>main.ts</code> file which is the starting point of our application.It is present in bootstrapmodule(Appmodule).</p>
<h2 id="webpack">Webpack</h2>
<h3 id="angular-uses-a-tool-called-webpack-which-is-a-static-module-bundler-dot-it-takes-all-our-html-css-and-js-files-and-bundles-them-into-a-single-file-which-is-loaded-by-the-browser-dot-it-bundles-application-source-code-into-convenient-chunks-to-improve-performance-and-load-times-dot">Angular uses a tool called <code>webpack</code> which is a static module bundler.It takes all our HTML,CSS and JS files and bundles them into a single file which is loaded by the browser. It bundles application source code into convenient chunks, to improve performance and load times.</h3>
<h2 id="hot-module-replacement">Hot Module replacement</h2>
<p>Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is a feature of webpack that allows developers to update code changes without the need for a full page reload.
When a code change is made, HMR only updates the module that has been modified, which means the application can continue running while the changes are applied.</p>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a fruitful and amazing year.And that means documenting my small journey as a blog post.
Work New friends and mentors I joined my new work place in September 2021 &amp;amp; had the pleasure to meet some amazing developers and colleagues.
I got the opportunity to learn a lot while on the job, through mentors, environment &amp;amp; infrastructure itself.
Promoted to Software Engineer 2 The title says all and I am grateful for it.</description>

<p>I joined my new work place in September 2021 &amp; had the pleasure to meet some amazing developers and colleagues.</p>
<p>I got the opportunity to learn a lot while on the job, through mentors, environment &amp; infrastructure itself.</p>
<h3 id="promoted-to-software-engineer-2">Promoted to Software Engineer 2</h3>
<p>The title says all and I am grateful for it. Without such an awesome environment, I wouldn&rsquo;t have faced the challenges, support and mentorship that I did.</p>
<h2 id="blogging">Blogging</h2>
<h3 id="migrating-my-blog-from-jekyll-to-hugo">Migrating my  blog from Jekyll to Hugo</h3>
<p>I regretted not writing more posts in 2019 even though I had my blog setup on Jekyll .
It was not the lack of time that bothered me but more of lack of proper process.</p>
<p>As atomic habits books rightly said to develop a habit ,the habit must be easier to execute.After shifting to Doom
Emacs this year to make documentation, it made sense to shift my blog from Jekyll to Hugo(Incoming blog post stay tuned!).</p>
<p>Writing my posts in markdown just for my blog was creating the friction in my writing process.
Writing all my posts in .org mode helped me reduced that friction and made my process better.</p>
<p>Also by introducing small Today I learnt concepts (tils) posts helped me further in being consistent in writing. As I wrote about the the things I learnt while working and didn&rsquo;t need to invest extra time and effort into researching and writing separate posts.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learnt">Lessons learnt:</h2>
<h3 id="do-one-thing-at-a-time">Do one thing at a time</h3>
<p>One of the biggest lessons I have learnt this year is not to take on too many projects at once .To focus on one thing and to do that properly.
I have realised doing too many things at once , made me rush to one project haphazardly so I could complete the next one .
This is reminder to myself to complete a project to a satisfactory stage  and then move on.</p>
<h3 id="document-your-software-process-journey-before-while-doing-it-dot">Document your software process/journey before/while doing it.</h3>
<p>Documentation  about the work I has always felt like a daunting task to me.But not having proper docs has been more painful.</p>
<p>One of key lessons, I am still learning is to make the document while working on the project.
To treat writing as a part of the development process and not as an afterthought.
One way I recently realised how to do this is to write the titles and subtitles about dos .This helps in breaking down a big problem into a small one.
Example:
Im trying to put in place this strategy for blog writing too.</p>
<h3 id="be-organised">Be organised</h3>
<p>I found my old diary of 2013 (when I was still preparing for JEE mains ).  It showed me a reflection of how I used to organize content for my studies so why not for learning while working and for blogging?
<img loading="lazy" src="/img/diary.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>This is why I made the decision to learn doom Emacs and vim and use org-mode as a part of being organized.
There is a steep learning curve in Emacs. I myself have given up many times on Emacs and have come back because of the useful features it provides.</p>
<h3 id="done-is-better-than-perfect">Done is better than perfect</h3>
<p>A lesson I learnt the hard way.
All the planning and over thinking can do no good if you don&rsquo;t execute the plan.
Just start with an initial plan and start executing it.  Putting a little thought into the execution can lead to remarkable results.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-next">What&rsquo;s next?</h2>
<h3 id="automation-of-content-creation-flow">Automation of content creation flow</h3>
<p>Continuing to refine my blog content creation post workflow, I will explore ways to reach out to wider audience. To do this in such a way that it doesn&rsquo;t take much mental effort from my side.
And to find a way to reduce my time and effort in the proof reading &amp; editing process.(Any advice or suggestions are welcome!)</p>
<h3 id="getting-better-at-note-taking-and-diagram-making">Getting better at note taking and diagram making</h3>
<p>One of the key goals for 2023 is taking the effort to make quick diagrams. I have understood concepts quicker by looking at diagrams than reading blocks of text .
But diagram making tends to be a long time consuming task. I am currently trying out draw.io and excalidraw for this purpose ,still at experimental stage tho.</p>
<h3 id="trying-out-public-speaking-or-podcast-of-my-learning">Trying out public speaking or podcast of my learning</h3>
<p>While explaining a concept to a friend or colleague helped in finding out the gaps in my learning. Though I tried to explain a concept to myself while learning, I tend to find it awkward or sometimes lazy to re-iterate to explain the concept back to myself. One of my goals is to get better at speaking and hopefully not bore my little audience.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all for my year end review  for 2022 !</p>

      <description>After a long series of procrastination and getting the hit of motivation from reading Atomic Habits(great book which I recommend others) ,I’m finally learning kubernetes basics.As a motivator to get better at writing and publish more posts as well as learn kubernetes.I have decided to publish 1 article every Sunday.I would like to post 2 posts per week but I want to start small and consistent. Once again I’m treating my blog as a journal to showcase how much I actually understand kubernetes.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a long series of procrastination and getting the hit of motivation from reading Atomic Habits(great book which I recommend others) ,I’m finally learning kubernetes basics.As a motivator to get better at writing and publish more posts as well as learn kubernetes.I have decided to publish 1 article every Sunday.I would like to post 2 posts per week but I want to start small and consistent. Once again I’m treating my blog as a journal to showcase how much I actually understand kubernetes.Also its quite handy to have my own notes on a site. So here is a blog post on kubernetes basics part 1.This will be a multi part series. Before we begin some pre requisites which one needs to know :-</p>
<h2 id="pre-requisite">Pre requisite</h2>
<p>You should be already familiar and comfortable with the concept of containers and container run-time such as docker as kubernetes is for managing different containers and their deployment at a large scale.Another point which is not mandatory but good to know would be basic docker commands like docker run etc.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-kubernetes">What is kubernetes?</h2>
<p>Kubernetes is an open-source technology that is used for container orchestration. And what is container orchestration exactly? It is the process of continuous deployment ,scaling and management of containers.</p>
<p>Lets first look at the kubernetes architecture and the individual components in it.</p>
<h2 id="node">Node:</h2>
<p>A Node is either a physical or virtual machine on wihc kubernetes is installed. A node is like a worker machine on which containers (having our application) will be running by Kubernetes.And like any other machine ,nodes can crash for a number of reasons ;) .So once the node crashes the application will be go down as well. So tackle this we need multiple nodes rather than 1 node.</p>
<p>And mulitple nodes come together to form a group known as the cluster.So even if one node inside the cluster fails,we have our application accessible and running from the other nodes.Plus it helps in sharing load!</p>
<h2 id="master-node">* Master Node :</h2>
<p>So now we have our cluster running on a group of nodes which are running our containerised apps.But who is responsible to manage this cluster:?Also when a node goes down how to direct the traffic of the failed node to other working nodes?Also who stores the information about these worker nodes stored? and How are the nodes monitored?</p>
<p>The master node!</p>
<p>The master node is another machine with kubernetes installed in it and it watches over the nodes and does the actusl orchestration of the worker nodes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that a cluster can have multiple master nodes depending on the size of the cluster.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>because at the end of the day , a master node is a machine (which can crash) and for high availability we need to avoid that.</p>
<h2 id="other-components">Other components:</h2>
<p>When you install kubernetes in your system,you are actually installing the follwing components:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Kube api server (Master)</li>
<li>An etcd service (Master)</li>
</ul>
<p>-A kubelet service (Worker)</p>
<ul>
<li>Controller (Master)</li>
<li>Scheduler (Master)</li>
<li>Container Runtime</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="kube-api-server">Kube API server:</h2>
<p>Kubeapi server acts as a frontend for kubernetes.The users,commandline tools,managment devices all interact with the cluster via the Kube API server.</p>
<h2 id="etcd">etcd</h2>
<p>etcd is a distributed key value store used to store data about how to manage the cluster.It is also resp0onsible to implement logs within the cluster to ensure there is no conflict between mulitple masters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that your application data is not stored in etcd only logs and information about the cluster.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="scheduler">Scheduler</h2>
<p>Scheduler is responsible is distributing containers across multiple nodes.It looks for newly created containers and assigns them to nodes.</p>
<h2 id="controllers">Controllers</h2>
<p>Controllers are the brain behind the orchestration. They are responsible for notcining and responding nodes,containers or endpoint goes down.The controller takes decsions to bring up new nodes in this case.</p>
<h2 id="container-runtime">Container Runtime</h2>
<p>The container runtime is the underying software that runs the containers.Most of the times,its docker.I have used docker but there are other runtimes such as CRI-O</p>
<h2 id="kubeletpermalink">KubeletPermalink</h2>
<p>Kubelet is an agent that runs on each worker node in the cluster. The agent is in charge of making sure that containers are running on the nodes as expected.</p>
<h2 id="master-vs-worker-nodespermalink">Master vs Worker nodesPermalink</h2>
<p>So now we know there are 2 types of nodes : Masternode and Worker node. How does a node become master or a worker node? A worker node has the containers are hosted and running .Hence to run these containers we need a Container Runtime such as docker installed in these machines.</p>
<p>The master has a kube API server and this is what differentiates the master from worker nodes. The worker node have the kubelet agent that interacts with the master to proivide health information about the worker nodes and carries out the instrcutions given by the master node on worker nodes.The master has all this information stored in key value store (etcd) known as the etcd.The master also has the controller and scheduler.</p>
<h2 id="kubectlpermalink">KubectlPermalink</h2>
<p>kubectl is a commandline tool is used to deploy and manage applications in a cluster.Basically we are going to use these commands from the kubectl tool to get us information (kubectl get,status describe) about the nodes and other components in the cluster and to manage many other operations.</p>
<p><code>kubectl run</code> –Used to deploy an application onto the cluster</p>
<p><code>kubectl get cluster-info</code> –Used to fetch the cluster information</p>
<p><code>kubectl get nodes</code> –Used to fetch information about nodes.</p>
<p>That is all on basic overview.Next article will be focused on pod and how pods work in nodes in kubernetes.</p>

      <title>Tech Recap Journal- January📓</title>
      <link>https://codeklutz.com/posts/tech-recap-journal-january/</link>

      <description>I tried a lot of things in January not necessarily everything learnt was used and and not every side project which I worked on got live.
However I learnt many lessons from my own failures and gained more insights when I started some initiatives. So just a small gist of looking back on January and mid February.
My Blog! codeklutz.com I have been wanting to make my own tech blog for a while now but I needed something which didn’t necessary requires much code or db maintenance.</description>

<p>However I learnt many lessons from my own failures and gained more insights when I started some initiatives. So just a small gist of looking back on January and mid February.</p>
<h2 id="my-blog-codeklutz-dot-com">My Blog! <a href="https://codeklutz.com">codeklutz.com</a></h2>
<p>I have been wanting to make my own tech blog for a while now but I needed something which didn’t necessary requires much code or db maintenance.I didn’t want to opt for WordPress for the same reason.</p>
<p>Jekyll with GitHub pages is a life saver here! Also learnt a lot on custom domains after buying my own domain,about Google analytic and SEO.Plus customising Jekyll site with themes has been fun.</p>
<h2 id="letters-to-me">Letters to me</h2>
<p>This idea struck me in the wee hours at night.I always get some random tech ideas or where I am curious about something and think about it as to how I would do this particular task.</p>
<p>I think of this site as an idea jar 💡 or tech journal 📝 where I jot down my wacky, scrambling thoughts.Something which I can look back on for ideas when I don’t feel creative or as starting thinking point for my small side projects.Some tech thoughts which aren’t polished enough for a blog but are useful tiny ideas which provide insight.
Also since it’s on the internet maybe someone might find it useful or insightful? I’m thinking of adding an rss feed to this in the future if anyone would be interested in following this.</p>
<h2 id="expiermenting-with-audio-in-blogs">Expiermenting with audio in blogs</h2>
<p>Based on the idea mentioned in letters.codeklutz.com decided to implement an audio feature for this blog.I tried finding some open source or free alternative.And I did find one but sadly this one proved to be a failure at the current moment.</p>
<p>The audio is decent but the voices which I found are too mechanical and monotonous to listen continuously.I shall still try finding some open source alternative because I don’t want to invest in paid alternatives for this small blog at the moment.</p>
<h2 id="noteklutz-https-note-dot-codeklutz-dot-com">NoteKlutz <a href="https://note.codeklutz.com">https://note.codeklutz.com</a></h2>
<p>This mini project is again a part of implementation of the idea mentioned in letters.codeklutz.com It already proving to be useful;) I realised I write more markdown (for creating study notes +writing this blog) so I felt the need to create my own editor which is suited for myself and at the same time not fear giving my data to someone or idk?(lmao)</p>
<p>But main focus was not to use another app just to create notes and since I use browser more than anything else this seemed like a good idea</p>
<p>It’s a small,minimal project which does exactly what I need it to do and does it right (at least for me biased here🤫) It’s like my second organising brain 🧠.The code is an absolute mess and needs heavy work which I will do my pushing small updates on weekends🤭.</p>
<p>So this was all for January and Mid Feb</p>
