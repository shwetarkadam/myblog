# My First Tech Talk: The Journey from Panic to Presentation

I recently had an opportunity to give a technical talk at GitTogether Mumbai. This is a small blog post based on my experience of giving a talk and a little behind-the-scenes turmoil written as a blog post.

## How Do You Secure a Speaking Slot?

This was the big question! It took me countless applications, several rejections, and a sprinkle of luck. The trick? Pitch a talk that fits what the audience and organizers are looking for—it's all about relevance.

## What happens after my talk was selected?

The talk has been selected ......so now what?
The Panic strikes through!!
But so does the cycle of preparation......

## Will They Find It Interesting?

Creating a talk is one thing, delivering it in a way that keeps the audience engaged is another. 
Once the panic and excitement strikes through so does the preparation. Preparing the contents for a talk is very different from presenting it. The information you INTEND to convey has to reach the audience in a way they perceive it and it has to be relatable and interesting for them to continue to listen!

## Feedback Feedback Feedback and Continuous Feedback!

Ah yes, feedback—every speaker’s best friend (and occasional frenemy). It’s the secret sauce to leveling up your presentation, and trust me, you’ll need lots of it! I took every nugget of constructive criticism and tweaked my talk like a codebase on release day.

Now, let’s talk demos. The ultimate double-edged sword. Engineers love them but for presenters? A living nightmare! And guess what? I willingly walked into that nightmare. Yep, I gave a demo!

Why? Well, demos are like live-action thrillers—great for the audience but full of nerve-wracking moments for the speaker. Something is bound to go wrong (and spoiler: it did). Cue the sweaty palms and heart palpitations as things start to go wrong! But hey, the key is to stay calm, crack a joke or two, and power through the glitches.

In hindsight, the demo could’ve been smoother, but for my first big talk, it wasn’t a complete disaster. Want to witness the chaos? Here’s the link to the demo fail [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_D0SG0yMEk) I’m open to feedback (and maybe a little sympathy)!

## Final Thoughts
Every developer should experience the thrill of presenting their work to an appreciative public audience. It's more than just sharing your knowledge—it’s a chance to push your limits, boost your confidence, and ignite a deeper passion for learning. Stepping onto that stage changes the way you see yourself as a developer, fueling your drive to grow and evolve. Plus, there’s nothing quite like the energy of connecting with others and realizing how far you’ve come on your journey!
