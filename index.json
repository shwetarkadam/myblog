[{"content":"I deployed my portfolio site and wanted to try out github actions and this is my experience of automating the deployment. This article is more focused on how you can use the GitHub actions and how easy it is to deploy your code to GitHub pages rather than the portfolio site code.So every time you make an update or build to your website ,the changes are automatically reflected and this automated deploying process makes work much faster.\nThe way GitHub action works is you create actions in your repositories by creating one or more yaml files and these are called workflows.Workflows now can handle build tasks like CI CD. This means you use the action to test your code and push the site to the desired hosting platform (in this case GitHub pages ) when the main branch changes . First step assuming that you have a GitHub account is to create a repository having your website code in it.Now I have a bootstrap website but in the future I do plan on adding node JS so I already added package.json.\n{% gist 7fc9e560ec958d6fb9876019e298e02f %}\n{ \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;shwetarkadam.github.io\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1.0.0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Portfolio\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;main\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;index.html\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;scripts\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;build\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;npm run clean \u0026amp;\u0026amp; npm run imagemin \u0026amp;\u0026amp; npm run copyfonts \u0026amp;\u0026amp; npm run copydata \u0026amp;\u0026amp; npm run usemin\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;clean\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;rimraf dist\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;copyfonts\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;copyfiles -f node_modules/font-awesome/fonts/* dist/fonts\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;copydata\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;copyfiles -f src/js/* dist/js\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;imagemin\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;imagemin src/img/* -o dist/img\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;lite\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;lite-server\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;start\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;npm run lite\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;test\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;echo \\\u0026#34;Error: no test specified\\\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; exit 1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;usemin\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;usemin index.html -d dist --htmlmin -o dist/index.html\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;repository\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;git\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;git@github.com:shwetarkadam/portfolio.git\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;author\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Shweta Kadam\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;license\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;MIT\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dependencies\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;bootstrap\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^4.4.1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;font-awesome\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^4.7.0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;jquery\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^3.5.1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;popper.js\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^1.16.0\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;devDependencies\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;copyfiles\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^2.2.0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;imagemin-cli\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^5.1.0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;lite-server\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^2.5.4\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;rimraf\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^3.0.2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;usemin-cli\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^0.6.0\u0026#34; } } Verify all your changes as correct by first in your root folder running the command:\nnpm install npm install\nand after installing node modules run the command:\nrun npm start so you should get your output in localhost something like this\nNow that you have ensured that the project runs properly in your local machine,it is ready to be deployed to GitHub pages. You will only need to commit and push your changes to the main branch of a repo and ensure that the settings are pointing to the correct branch to display a site for that. Now the file that does this is that deploy.yml file which we will use to create the workflow.\nname: Build and Deploy on: push: branches: - main jobs: build-and-deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Checkout uses: actions/checkout@v2 with: persist-credentials: false - name: Install and 06Build run: | npm install npm run build - name: Deploy uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@releases/v3 with: GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} BRANCH: gh-pages FOLDER: dist Now this yaml file which can be found .github/workflows/deploy.yml file in local ,you can rename the file whatever you like.It tells the github actions to install the project dependencies run a build script and put that required files in a output folder name dist and upload the contents of the dist folder to the gh-pages branch and if the branch does not exist it will create that branch.The workflow to deploy the site to github-pages you can find that from James Ives GitHub pages deploy action. If you have any existing site or code and you want to publish it to get pages you only need this file to be added into your project. You could go to your github repo Actions Tab -\u0026gt; Create Simple Workflow and copy paste the above content in your yaml file.\nOnce you have a site ready for GitHub Pages, and your project includes the .github/workflows/deploy.yml file, you only need to commit and push your changes to the main branch of your repository. You can the ongoing workflow by going to Actions=\u0026gt;build and deploy.Also this is the place where you can debug what went wrong in case your workflow fails.\nAfter the GitHub Actions have run, ensure settings are pointing to the correct branch to display your site. Go to the settings of your repository and ensure that the source for GitHub Pages is using the correct branch. It is close to the bottom of the main settings page.\nIt does take some time at the start to load in the browser but once available you can click on the link in the green bar above.

But recently due to unforeseen updates, my bios was messed up big time which has led me unable to install Linux for the time being. But the work and learning never stops and nor shall I ! ☺ I don’t hate windows but it’s definitely not my first choice for development and coding after discovering Linux.🤭\nBut Thanks to WSL, windows terminal, and the beautiful zsh .I can get that Linux experience on windows!\nSo this is just a blog post on how I customized my terminal on windows 10 using wsl, windows terminal,zsh, and many more fun plugins which I use on my Linux as well as windows for development(work or home).\nWhat is wsl? It stands for windows subsystem for Linux and it\u0026rsquo;s a feature of Windows that allows developers to run Linux file systems,command-line tools etc directly on windows!(Goodbye painful windows mouse navigation) First, you need the wsl feature on windows 10 by going to Start -\u0026gt;Type windows feature on search and below checkbox should be checked for enabling windows subsystem for Linux. Now you need to install wsl which you can by going Start-\u0026gt; Microsoft store -\u0026gt;type ubuntu.Im installing Ubuntu wsl since I\u0026rsquo;m familiar with it you can also change distros. I\u0026rsquo;m also installing another app called windows terminal because it\u0026rsquo;s much better in terms of ui to me as compared to Ubuntu terminal.This is optional. At this point, it\u0026rsquo;s your choice whether you want to continue with the Ubuntu terminal or use the windows terminal.If you decide with the former,skip the next para and if you decide with the latter then you need to set windows terminal as your default shell. Now by default windows terminal opens the power shell, to set to Ubuntu .Go to settings as shown below\nNow you have a Ubuntu shell that has bash. I personally use zsh with OhMyZsh for my work for that beautiful productivity. Using OhMyZsh features like navigating without using cd, usage of ll, easier tab-click based navigation, and much more!\nNote that zsh and OhMyZsh are different. When you install OhMyZsh, many plugins come with it for your rescue! So to install zsh. Update the libraries first then install zsh.\nsudo apt-get install update sudo apt install -y zsh Then Install ohmy zsh\nsh -c \u0026#34;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)\u0026#34; Now your previous~/.zshrc config will be replaced by ohmyzsh To customize the shell next install powerlevel10k.\ngit clone - depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k This command clones the repo and now go to your ~/.zshrc and set the theme as power level 10k And then\nsource ~/ .zshrc Note: To reflect every change you make, do source ~/.zshrc in the terminal. And then this will give you a set of options to configure which you can decide for your customization.\nMy favourite plugins I use these plugins daily and they make my life super smooth !\nFzf It\u0026rsquo;s a fuzzy finder command-line tool that lets your fuzzy find anything (files directories git branches you name it )across file system. You can use ti write your custom fuzzy find scripts to find anything.I have posted a link if my current config and aliases for reference. Clone the repo from any directory and just run the install script.\ngit clone - depth 1 https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.git ~/.fzf ~/.fzf/install Here is a small example of small WIP config for reference.\nZsh Auto-suggestions This one Autocompletes while you type a command.This is useful especially when you type commands which you use daily but need to to try multiple times such as navigating and printing log at a specific long location. Git Clone the zsh-autocomplete plugin in the OhMyZsh plugin folder.\n$ sudo git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions Once that is done, add the plugin in the ~/.zshrc file\u0026rsquo;s plugin list.\nplugins=( … zsh-autosuggestions ) Zsh Syntax highlighting This one automatically highlights zsh commands as you type. This saves a lot of typing on my part. Git Clone the zsh-syntax-highlighting plugin in the OhMyZsh plugin folder.\n$ sudo git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting And once again add it to the plugins list of the .zshrc file.\nplugins=( … zsh-syntax-highlighting ) Note: To reflect every change you make, do source ~/.zshrc in the terminal.\nReadymade Github Aliases from Oh My Zsh Usually one defines short github aliases such as g.b forgit branch or g.c for git checkout in ~/.zshrc but you know by using ohMyZsh already has a list of easy git aliases configured. The format is first 2–3 letters of the first letter of the command such as\ngb git branch List of local branches gba git branch -a List of local and remote branches gcam git commit -am Add all files to stage and commit gcmsg git commit -m Git commit message gco git checkout Change branch gco - git checkout to the previous branch Change branch to the previous one gd git diff Files differences in staging gfa git fetch - all - prune Fetch all remote branches, delete branch if upstream is gone gl git pull Pull from remote gp git push Push to remote gpsup git push - set-upstream origin [currentbranch] Set upstream branch gst git status Local files to commit I use these git aliases daily and they make working super fun.I recommend going through oh-my-zsh git aliases cheatsheets\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all folks! This is my current setup in windows for development and this is still a work in progress that can keep changing but these plugins and zsh are something that has made the experience of using windows quite fun.\n","permalink":"https://codeklutz.com/posts/making-peace-with-windowsinstalling-wslzshpowerlevel10kfzf-many-more-fun-plugins-for-easy-development/","summary":"avigation, editing, development using terminal and zsh .

I came across this swagger open API specification and this is a really handy tool!\nIn layman’s terms, Swagger OpenAPI specification provides API documentation for REST APIs. An OpenAPI file allows you to describe all the APIs within the project and even lets you try out the APIs!\nAvailable endpoints can be /projectApi and all operations on each endpoint which can GET /getProjectApi , POST /insertProjectApi , DELETE /deleteProjectApi .\n[[]] Also, integration of swagger open API is pretty painless in spring boot and it lets users try out the APIs within the browser without any installation of any software from the user (sounds pretty convenient and sweet to me)\nIn this post, I will describe how I integrated swagger open API in Spring boot project.First you need a spring boot project having basic dependcies using Spring Initializr https://start.spring.io/ or you could use this project used in the example here\nFirst add the springdoc-openapi-ui dependency to pom.xml:\n\u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springdoc\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;springdoc-openapi-ui\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;1.6.4\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; Then run the application and check the below url to check open api specification\nhttp://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs/ You should be able to see something like this\nYou can also add a custom path by adding entry in application.properties file\nspringdoc.api-docs.path=/api springdoc.swagger-ui.path=/swagger springdoc.swagger-ui.operationsSorter=method Check http://localhost:8080/swagger for web UI.To show you in this example we have a following apis in the controller\npackage com.TestDocker.BooksDocker.Controllers; import java.util.List; import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired; import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PathVariable; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestBody; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController; import org.springframework.web.server.ResponseStatusException; import com.TestDocker.BooksDocker.Models.Book; import com.TestDocker.BooksDocker.Repository.BookRepository; @RestController public class MainController { @Autowired public BookRepository bookRepository; @GetMapping(\u0026#34;/test\u0026#34;) public String test() { return new String(\u0026#34;Working from DOcker Bopoks proj \u0026#34;); } @GetMapping(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;) public List\u0026lt;Book\u0026gt; fetchAllBooks() { List\u0026lt;Book\u0026gt; books; try { books = bookRepository.findAll(); } catch (Exception ex) { throw new ResponseStatusException(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, \u0026#34;Error occured in fetchAllBooks\u0026#34;, ex); } return books; } @GetMapping(\u0026#34;/{bookID}\u0026#34;) public Book fetchBookfromID(@PathVariable(\u0026#34;bookID\u0026#34;) Long bookID) { Book book; try { book = bookRepository.getById(bookID); } catch (Exception ex) { throw new ResponseStatusException(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, \u0026#34;Error Occured in fetchBookfromID\u0026#34;, ex); } return book; } @GetMapping(\u0026#34;/search/{title}\u0026#34;) public List\u0026lt;Book\u0026gt; searchBookByTitle(@PathVariable(\u0026#34;title\u0026#34;) String title) { List\u0026lt;Book\u0026gt; books; try { //System.out.println(title); books = bookRepository.fuzzySearchByTitle(title); System.out.println(books); } catch (Exception ex) { throw new ResponseStatusException(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, \u0026#34;Error Occured in searchBookByTitle\u0026#34;, ex); } return books; } @PostMapping(\u0026#34;/insertBooks\u0026#34;) public String insertBooks(@RequestBody List\u0026lt;Book\u0026gt; books) { for (Book b : books) { System.out.println(b.toString()); Book b1 = bookRepository.save(b); if (b1 == null) return \u0026#34;Book object is null\u0026#34;; } return null; } } So the swagger ui look something like this. Also json docs will be available at http://localhost:8080/api springdoc.swagger-ui.operationsSorter=method sorts the API paths in order of their HTTP methods. You can try and test the apis from web ui too.It also shows schema information! Overall this is a much convenient way of setting up documentation for your apis which can be handy in some situations.\nThat’s all folks!\n","permalink":"https://codeklutz.com/posts/integrating-swagger-openapi-for-easy-api-documentation-in-spring-boot/","summary":"These days I am more into creating backend projects which include microservices.But if anyone wants to test these services one needs postman or do the old classic way of curl command.\nBoth do the job brilliantly but what if I wanted some user who doesn’t want to install postman or use curl and still wants to test my live APIs thru the browser?

I ended up not using the cron job but rather went the SQL way(will explain this in detail below). However,in the process I learnt a lot about cron jobs and scheduling in spring boot so this is just a small article about my learnings.\nBut first I shall tell you a little about my use case and why I thought about cron jobs in the first place…..\nUse case My application was inserting data (let’s call it smash data for simplicity for now)in the database.Each smash data has a certain expiry period and after that expiry period, that data should no longer remain in the database.But the expiry period will be different for each smash data.\nExample:\nsmash 1, expiryperiod :10mins\nsmash 2 ,expiryperiod :60mins\nsmash 3 ,expiryperiod :150mins . . . etc.\nNow my first line of thinking ended up being cron jobs which led to me studying about cron jobs and scheduled in spring boot.To answer it simply I didn’t end up taking this route is because cron jobs or scheduled tasks are suited when we expect the task to execute at only a particular point of time or where we expect functionality to be executed at w particular time on an hourly/daily /weekly/monthly basis. I could get the cron job to delete the data but to delete WHICH data smash 1 or smash 2? That would mean I would have to check the DB. So the process would be something like:-\nFetch all rows from DB. Check timestamp of each row data against current timestamp and delete accordingly. I wanted to avoid writing the searching, comparing time logic (dates, in general, can be a pain sometimes).The logic which I did ended up going through was events in SQL since I’m using MySQL db for the use case\nMysql events are tasks that run according to a particular schedule …hence they can be called as scheduled events\nWhen an event is created in MySQL, a named database object is created and this object consists of one or more SQL statements to be executed at some regular intervals.Using events,I didn’t have to retrieve and search the data (as I had to do in the spring boot controller ) . I could just write an event such as\nDelete from table1 where expiry period \u0026lt; NOW(); And schedule this to execute every minute. Which was would check for that expiryPeriod column in each row and compare with time NOW() So any rows whose expiryperiod has passed will be deleted from db.\nThe only thing to note I see in this approach, for now, is that this is database dependent so when I host this side project (a hopeful dream) I need to make sure events is configured for the same. So this was the use case now back to cron jobs!\nCron jobs or schedule tasks in spring boot.Permalink When a situation arises where we expect the task to execute at only a particular point of time or where we expect functionality to be executed at a particular time on an hourly/daily /weekly/monthly basis. Cron jobs are suitable for this use case. In spring this sort of scheduled task can be achieved through @Scheduled annotation.\nThere are a few rules while using the @Scheduled annotation: 1. The method should typically have a void return type else the returned value will be ignored.\nthe method should not expect any parameters. First, to enable scheduling in the spring boot project, use @EnableScheduling in the main class.\npublic class Application { public static void main(String[] args) { SpringApplication.run(PasteBinApplication.class, args); } } Scheduling using CRON expressions Permalink @Component public class SchedulerService { @Scheduled(cron=\u0026#34;*/15 * * * * ?\u0026#34;) public void testScheduled() { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Method executed at every 15 seconds. Current time is :: \u0026#34;+ new Date()); } } A guide for cron jobs: cron Image source :Java Techonline\nSEC MIN HOURS DAY MONTH WEEKDAY * * * * * * Scheduling using initial delay,Fixed Delay or Fixed Rate The main difference between Fixed Delay and Fixed Rate is : Fixed Delay : controls the next execution time when the last execution finishes. Fixed Rate : makes Spring run the task on periodic intervals even if the last invocation may be still running.\nFixed Delay\n@Component public class SchedulerService { @Scheduled(fixedDelay = 1000, initialDelay = 5000) public void testScheduled() { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Method executed with fixed delay and initial delay . Current time is :: \u0026#34;+ new Date()); } } Also Fixed Delay can take input in String and Integer. @Scheduled(fixedDelayString = “7000”) @Scheduled(fixedDelayString = 7000) Fixed Rate:\n@Component public class SchedulerService { @Scheduled(fixedRate = 1000) public void testScheduled() { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Method executed with fixed rate . Current time is :: \u0026#34;+ new Date()); } } That’s all folks.Learning about events and cron jobs and where could be applied was interesting to learn when applied on some small practical application.\n","permalink":"https://codeklutz.com/posts/which-would-you-go-for-spring-boot-cron-jobscheduled-tasks-vs-events-in-mysql/","summary":"I was recently studying about using cron jobs in spring boot for a particular use case for my small side project.

By default every class has a constructor called default no argument constructor. class A{ A(){ //default no arg constructor }} A programmer can have multiple constructors in a class provided their signatures are different this is called constructor overloading. class A{ A(){ //some code } A(int x){ //some code } A(float x){ //some code } A(float x,int y){ //some code } A(int x,float y){ } A(int z){}//THIS WILL GIVE COMPILE ERROR SInce its already defined on top. } A a=new A(); new A();//goes to first matching constructor JVM always calls the matching constructor from the class.HOWEVER,a programmer can call other constructors of this class by using the the this() method. class A{ A(){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;); //I A(int x){ this(); //this will go to constructor A(); System.out.println(\u0026#34;AA\u0026#34;); //II } } class App{ public static void main(String[]args){ new A(5); }} OUTPUT: A AA If a programmer desires it can call the constructor of the super class as well from its own constructor using the super() method. class A{ A(){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;); //I } } class B extends A{ B(){ super(); //this is called implicitly refer next point also System.out.println(\u0026#34;B\u0026#34;); }} class HelloWorld { public static void main(String[] args) { new B(); } } OUTPUT: A B Whenever a programmer creates a constructor ,JVM writes super() in every constructor implicitly as its first line. Note:If a class does not extend any class it by default extends the Object class. Do Try this code in your ide to see it for yourself\nclass A{ A(){ //super will be called implicitly at the first line of this constructor and here since it does not extend any class it will extend the Object class System.out.println(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;); //I } A(int x){ //super will be called implicitly at the first line of this constructor System.out.println(\u0026#34;AA\u0026#34;); }} class HelloWorld { public static void main(String[] args) { new A(5); } } OUTPUT: A AA That’s all for constructors in Java.\nHappy Learning :)\n","permalink":"https://codeklutz.com/posts/how-constructors-work-in-java/","summary":"Constructors are used every time to initialize instance variables.
